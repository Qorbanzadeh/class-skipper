# What's class skipper?

It's a simple applescript program that will interact with your school's class or your meeting room in **Adobe Connect** while you're away! üòâ

PS: I'm not a professional AppleScript programmer! I just read the documentation and wrote this program.

‚ö†Ô∏è : This is not ready to be used yet.

TODO:

- [ ] test code
- [ ] production code
- [ ] ask the user to enter the meeting addrress (test or production)
